## Problem Statement and Solution

**Problem Statement:**
Modern applications demand a robust and flexible architecture that can handle varying workloads while maintaining security and high availability. Deploying such an infrastructure manually can be complex, error-prone, and time-consuming. The need for automated infrastructure provisioning is evident as organizations strive to ensure efficient resource utilization and minimize downtime during traffic surges.

**Solution:**
Our solution addresses these challenges head-on by harnessing the power of Terraform, an infrastructure-as-code tool. With this repository, you'll embark on a journey to craft a 3-Tier Architecture—comprising Web, App, and DB layers—on AWS. Each step is meticulously documented, enabling you to effortlessly recreate the entire infrastructure with a single command. Here's a glimpse of the magic you'll experience:

1. **VPC Creation and 3-Tier Architecture:** Craft a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with the essential tiers—Web, App, and DB—laying the foundation for your application's scalability and security.

2. **Security Group Sorcery:** Watch as AWS Security Groups weave a protective barrier around your architecture, safeguarding your Private EC2 Instances, Bastion Host, and Application Load Balancer.

3. **Private EC2 Instances:** Journey into the private realms of your VPC to summon two Private EC2 Instances, handling the core processing tasks of your application.

4. **Bastion Host and NAT Gateway:** Create a fortified entry point into your architecture with a Bastion Host, complete with a dedicated Elastic IP and a NAT Gateway for secure communication.

5. **Application Load Balancing Act:** Witness the orchestration of an Application Load Balancer, seamlessly distributing incoming traffic among your Private EC2 Instances for impeccable performance.

6. **Auto Scaling Symphony:** Craft a Launch Template and orchestrate an Auto Scaling Group that adapts to traffic fluctuations, ensuring optimal resource utilization and high availability.

7. **Scaling Intelligence:** Employ Target Tracking Scaling Policies to dynamically adjust your infrastructure's capacity, intelligently responding to performance metrics.

8. **Time-Bound Scaling:** With Scheduled Actions, learn how to predictively scale your infrastructure to meet anticipated traffic patterns efficiently.

9. **Notifying the Oracle:** Create an SNS Topic for notifications, allowing your architecture to communicate its state and events to the outside world.

**Get Started:**
